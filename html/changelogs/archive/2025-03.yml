  - qol: In keeping with recent lore developments, the clause for Orepit humans and
      Orepit IPCs no longer requires them to be Trinarists or in the Open Doors agreement.
      This also means that they can select more religions as well as have standard
      Coalition citizenship, and Orepit IPCs can select more accents.

      turned on.

  nauticall:
  - refactor: Moves the data containing cargo items (i.e. the ones you order from
      ops and get in the cargo shuttle) from the online database to the codebase.
  - refactor: Refactors cargo items to use singletons instead of datums for cargo_supplier,
      cargo_category, and cargo_item. Multiple-instnace things like cargo_orders,
      etc. still use datums.

      for various cargo items.

      you details instead of bluescreening.

      tooltips on suppliers. Also now has search functionality.
